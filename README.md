# Vehicle_Sales_Analysis_and_Dashboard
Using MS Powerpoint (only for my alternative dashboard) and MS Excel with tools such as Pivot tables, Pivot charts, LookUp functions, slicers, formatting tools etc. I created a sales dashboard permitting us to interprete the company's financial status and answering questions such as:
What are the most/least sold products?
Who are our highest/least buyers? (this could help us consider a merger with the buyer)
How does our sales progression look like over time?
How much did we make as sales and in what year?
How did each product perform in each year?

and so many other insightful questions we can answer, by using our slicers to filter through the data.

Any form of improvement, contribution or criticism is highly welcomed
