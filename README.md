# Vehicle_Sales_Analysis_and_Dashboard
Using data obtained from kaggle, i created a sales dashboard in MS Excel.

Firstly I cleaned the spreadsheet by removing duplicate values/redundant data, using some formatting tools and eliminating erronous information. This contributed in making the spreadsheet easier to navigate, interprete and analyse.
I proceeeded to rearrange the columns for better data comprehension without compromising the integrity of the data.
I then created the columns needed in order to create a meaningful dashboard using the appropriate formulas.
Using tools such as Pivot tables, Pivot charts, LookUp functions, slicers, formatting tools etc, i created a sales dashboard permitting us to interprete the company's financial status and answering questions such as:

What are the most/least sold products?
Who are our highest/least buyers? (this could help us consider a merger with the buyer)
How does our sales progression look like over time?
How much did we make as sales and in what year?
How did each product perform in each year?

Other insightful questions can be answered by using our slicers to filter through the data and target our point of interest.

Any form of improvement, contribution or criticism is highly welcomed
